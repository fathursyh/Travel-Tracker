## BACKEND JOURNEY
---
This is one of the project which the teacher use to practice my node js and postgres skill.
The key points of this repo are :
1. I was using postgres as an object of a class with the name of **PostgresDB**
2. I changed the initial input requirement by the teacher from **input** to **select**
3. Planning on deploying this somewhere where my friends can use it, but I'm not sure ðŸ˜’
4. The postgres action that I use including :
   - Select
   - Insert
